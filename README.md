# First-pygame
This is the first pygame I ever made

The game is infinite so when you pass a level the game speeds up. You pass a level by getting rid of all the bricks with the ball or laser.

 If you wanted to change the game mode change the True or False at the top under cheats/sound. True is makes the thing turn on and False turns it off.
 
 The controls are left arrow key,right arrow key,A, and D to move the paddle. If up_down is True then space bar to shoot the laser if it is False then space bar and up arrow key.
